				we are a group of individuals from around the globe that have observed and worked in the field of DEI and sustainability for quite some years now. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>	
				one thing we all have in common: we are tired of observing sustainability and DEI as a trend and we are worried how the industry around sustainability is currently developing - especially when it comes to companies. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>	
thatâ€™s why we decided to take a turn and walk a new path - focusing on two things
				<br>&nbsp;<br>	
				<strong>1.</strong> unlearning - a process that invites you to take a few steps back from the patterns we all internally have - especially when it comes to succeeding in the fast thriving environment we are all working in. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>				
<strong>2.</strong> to look at DEI and sustainability in (for now) often unseen ways - and to give all of us the opportunity to explore these topics from new angles. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>	
the result is larger.world: an unlearning platform for DEI and sustainability managers and everyone who is open to approach those topics from new perspectives - in order to really contribute to the changes that are so urgently needed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>	
thank you for taking this journey with us!
